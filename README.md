# APL Demos

---

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

In this repo, I have added all the code that I've used in these tutorials:

1. [Display a Text using APL in an Alexa Skill](https://youtu.be/0psR9juV4vI)
2. [Display a Button using APL in an Alexa Skill](https://youtu.be/mnBkPp0OX38)
3. Play an Audio using APLA through a Button in an Alexa Skill. (Coming up!)
4. Design Multimodal Responses for APL Screen. (Coming up!)
5. Display an Image using APL in an Alexa Skill. (Coming up!)

Steps to run this code:

Go to your [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask) and Create a new skill. 

Once, you are done naming your skill, setting up the language model and custom model, in the templates page, click on **Import from Github**. 

Copy and Paste the Git URL for this Repo: https://github.com/dabblelab/apl-demos.git

That's it, now your skill would be ready to go!

But wait! You still need to go to interfaces:
